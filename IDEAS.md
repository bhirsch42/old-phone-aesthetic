Do the story where an AI is scanning the wreckage of a destroyed space station to determine what happened.

Old timey aesthetic is because you, the AI, are trying to minimize your own resource usage to give more power to the simulation. You have paused all of your other Copies for the same reason.

Sometimes you go into stasis waiting for updates from the AI.

After the first long stasis, you get a message from your mother asking to talk to you, then an automated message about your death, then an automated message about your mother's death

If there's a reason to send a message, do like hackertyper, where it types the same thing no matter which buttons you press.
